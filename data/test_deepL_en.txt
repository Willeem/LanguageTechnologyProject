From az, updated on 2018-05-04 at 11:11
Yeah, she wants...
"Beautiful Munich girl" in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not be alone in the romantic candlelight shooting in front of the MY SOLARIS, but will be at the side of Male-model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, coquetting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver at the shooting with people photographer Tuan and brave wind, spray and rain like true professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that naturally depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other way, as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" in the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that has now lasted for months, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national team player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
Up to a certain point I also assumed that this would be the case," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified this resignation by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a discussion with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change clubs, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about yet".
Linz: Garden shed in allotment garden settlement burnt down
At 14.13 the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the allotment garden settlement, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be cleared out to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had plugged in a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it must be considerable, because the owner had many collectors' items in his garden shed.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") herself streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This was reported by the US portal "TMZ" and published a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed for Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, she provides no evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this," Lohan can be heard in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's going to turn around and slap Lohan in the face.
With tears in her eyes, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she turns the cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This is the task of "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so close that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets in early August when he announced the withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now the two have come to an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss retires from the supervisory board, but he may remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Closely guarded - the Tories' party conference
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference is to deal with foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson in the front line.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doublings for years.
Now they've come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future and the population is voting on this Sunday - is it going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
Brazil's "trump card" is claiming to be an anti-system candidate and is therefore ahead in the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still around," said Peter Mertens, Director of Development, to the trade journal "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, Rupert Stadler, the head of Audi, who was arrested and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations will probably be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in coming to terms with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas fraud was made public.
He had known about the manipulations or had deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot, Sales Director, manages the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audimodels A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to be elected to DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel intends to run for the office of DFB President again next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning in the "Aktuelles Sportstudio" of ZDF.
You have to keep trying for re-election, that's what I'm going to do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if, after being awarded the contract for the 2024 European Football Championship, he did not "feel like working on the project of the future".
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown in the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is to work on the DFB presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Presiding Committee agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Presiding Committee and will then of course be invited to make his experience available for sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become a DFB integration ambassador.
At present, this office is held by the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, "this is an important issue, we have to deal with it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Correctly remove with a half-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but that is more for the sausages.
Doesn't say anything about me replacing fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the German Basketball League with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena the runner-up won without any problems 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berlin team with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in his debut match in front of 9113 spectators.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came in 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter with 24 points for coach John Patrick's team.
EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
The Basketball Löwen Braunschweig scored a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings outdid the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority shareholder since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with, among others, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In its opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were on duty - among them snipers.
The Islamic association Ditib is under criticism because it is considered the extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, booing and scaring
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of an audience of 60,000.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations also appeared on stage during the spectacle which lasted several hours.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunfire, got scared and tried to flee.
For a short time panic arose, people ran in confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
But then the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You're all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get hold of one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
The audience cheered and applauded the numerous musicians and actors, while Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate's Judiciary Committee in favour of nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, thereby offending many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to and including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who claim to have experienced sexual assaults themselves confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You're welcome to join me in an elevator at any time," Flake now told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freiheit für Journalisten" (freedom for journalists) and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely irrespective of whether or not the request is justified.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or being members of forbidden parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, legal proceedings against them are still pending in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
That's how fresh and handsome his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by NDR, is known for humorous conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller will toast with her guests to some beer, some wine or even high-proof drinks to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities drink themselves courageous even for the obligatory vocal parts.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time there: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the far north was not good for the Munich resident.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely wrinkled on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he just has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings, which he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas night.
Rule two: never drink the black pig.
And spritz.
And the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past two, leave out too.
Alcohol consumption is truly written all over the 43-year-old's face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused at the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking binge is not known yet.
But since she has been presenting the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa's been dealing with vandalism and garbage
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Little Red Riding Hood Land in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly apparent.
Broken glass, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presenting itself for quite some time.
A more than inglorious sight for the showpiece railway cycle path in Little Red Riding Hood Land.
The topic occupies members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt in addition, others already longer, so the bicycle traffic representative of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Board.
A solution has not yet been found.
The suggestions ranged from moving the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought up the topic in the local advisory council.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for celebrating on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but the banquets also involve destruction: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area along the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting point for binge drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the main focus here on the Haaße hill is clearly on the Haaße," confirms the bike traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
A further idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This might raise the threshold for violating public property.
However, this would require a police patrol to come by promptly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haass Hill developed.
It had to be made more attractive.
He said that he was very satisfied with the frequency of use of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing still has room for improvement.
Our cycle path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany," say the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger zone.
There is no turning lane on the Haass Hill.
In busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive in the "Music contest for young and experienced musicians, big and small".
A contest "with a twinkle in the eye in the likeable Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it soon became a family gathering with coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from a one-man band to a large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener living in Hiltrup for a long time, the Nine from the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters feel connected with?
Among the towns, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly often.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but that he now also taught guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest on the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed all kinds of stuff on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Additional musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup hit, which impressed Franke especially with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the final - and even without electronic support they sounded "really good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had created the event to mark its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very full Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
There is a screen for each page, containing four cards with keywords which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once they have been inserted.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it says from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
Second window.
Third dice.
Fourth fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms but the codes that are to be guessed here.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" we are not supposed to guess the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team if possible does not; because this wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the cipherer-keeper notes down and reads out loud: "throw" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the lintel there.
And so it continues round after round, team after team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can make sense of them better with every hint the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too wacky, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and in detail before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you have started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this unimpressive game.
All in all, however, "Decrypto" isn't quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of few words, but instead is much better played in small groups.
And if you're only interested in guessing and not in victory points, you can easily come up with a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, later he attracted attention in a pub in the Upper Town as well, when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated and did not comply with the police's order to leave the prison, he had to spend the night in the prison cell at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate.
In a sober state, he must then also answer criminally for the use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig depot was home to the push locomotives
The railway depot in Pressig was for decades the hub of the Frankenwald.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"Whenever buffers banged on buffers, you could hear it all over the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who is archiving the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes squeaked and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic of Dinkel's home town Pressig.
Nowhere else in the Franconian Forest has a place been so shaped by the railway.
This was the starting point of the steep-ramped mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, in the past, pulling and pushing locomotives were needed which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, an apprentice's workshop, catenary and railway maintenance department.
"At its heart was the turntable, which, after reconstruction in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
The Pressig depot (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported that the staff was 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for pulling and pushing locomotives.
From 1977 on they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 cars were still being shunted per month.
In 1982 parts of the depot were demolished, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport, has not been considered".
Still at Whitsun 1989 the railway management Nuremberg celebrated the anniversary "50 years electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station party in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The shunters and brake shoe layers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2, 6-2 against Kristina Mladenovic from France.
The next opponent of the world number three is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund was leading 6:3, 4:2 against Dariah Cassatkina when the Russian, who was set at number 13, gave up.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 specimens by 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been with us since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
But a little surprisingly Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
In the past, both have been active in selecting artists and designing flyers.
This year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them again, available at every Kunststation.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high level of interest in the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Wind Chimes Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate, the "tree of happiness" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right hand side.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as sound pieces.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object appears fairy-tale like pensive and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway along the route, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind chime performance" invites you to stroll through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the people of Albachten also gave vent to their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They absolutely did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," predicted Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation's celebration especially for the anniversary.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was, for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows as usual in the "House of Encounter", but rather comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln tightened the knobs and asked for the dance floor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten let their voices sound themselves.
Happy songs were announced to suit the occasion.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin name for "hops", was heard.
Again sovereign was the choir direction by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time.
"It's simply fun to sing under his direction", said Holstiege: "He has such an easy manner, it's a masterpiece he performs". By the way, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly comprises evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had been sitting at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd division women: USC II wins high class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascender marches.
Three games, three victories - the USC Münster reserves under the patronage of Axel Büring are doing really well in league three.
No sign of shyness or tails, the independents are doing their thing.
And that at the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied". On the contrary.
In the evening at a belated birthday party of Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game was over.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the guests had a set point.
"If they bring it to the finish line, such a game can sometimes tip the scales," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally the USC with its experienced forces made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We all know who's on the other side in a derby like this.
That won't break our necks.
I have seen really good volleyball at times", Annacker did not quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents will take them does not seem to be foreseeable after just three matchdays.
"It is simply too early for that", says Axel Büring.
Only in one thing he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an unbelievably good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball". They do not want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, you must look up.
But a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we first go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

The cars had to be towed away.
Emergency forces of the Hildburghausen fire brigade cleared the accident site.
Glider crashes - student pilot has a fatal accident
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The single-seater plane crashed into a parking lot not far from the Essen-Mülheim airport on Sunday afternoon when landing, a police spokesman said in Essen on Sunday.
The parking lot next to Autobahn 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the trade fair, was largely empty, and other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency chaplains continued to look after flight students and eyewitnesses on site.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue of an Oktoberfest, and numerous guests were expected there in the evening.
The cause of the crash was unclear at first - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport that is used a lot by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumschiff" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series might have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on 01.January 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been one reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells in an interview with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "Traumschiff".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried to be "the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In plain English this means: "I have disguised myself", as she explains.
She had always had the feeling that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who in truth I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could also fail a second time".
The day before the civil wedding I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love back then "like in the movies.
Unfortunately this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I was far too naive in my approach to love".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ Zurich department, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but it is a little shady.
And the garish shine in which a green carpet on the Sechseläutenplatz is dipped dazzles him excessively.
But it is simply a film festival, more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he staggers across the square on this late Thursday evening to take a short break in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The public bathroom on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a great effort to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, the men's oasis stinks to high heaven for some reason.
So get out of here, cross over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level by the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name fits this film festival perfectly: As is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
You have to think of a lot of things when writing an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around its antennae, which a good fairy has given it, and two brawny doormen actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the guests crowd around each other, dancing to live music well after midnight or letting themselves be dictated by DJ rhythms to which they shout at each other and wash down exquisite morsels with cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a fountain of chocolate bubbles up.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You gotta love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign by the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he's got the dress code wrong.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", fitting for the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to the mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that night either.
But then, between local celebrities, the cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes by that looks familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading man should not be far behind.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, at almost sixty years of age and almost looking like a choirboy, starts walking through the crowd.
He is not approached, not gawked at, at most one squints furtively.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as inhibition, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is happy about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home country Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the dressing room, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division team had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV broadcasting after last minute bankruptcy "devastated"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - played not badly over long periods, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led 8:1, even the early time-out that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team", Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
At the break the gap was only two goals down.
Above all Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met during this phase time and time again.
After the change it became even better from the visitors' point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalized to 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly comforting three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened in the events.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking blame from others.
But: The 120 second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff received, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, stood up well against seven men in the back and threw on the empty goal again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we need a damn victory," said the fully served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof district), the police are searching for the woman's mortal remains.
Emergency forces dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as the police and public prosecutor's office jointly announced.
New evidence suggests that the missing person may have been buried not far from her former home.
The woman disappeared on November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at that time either.
Since last year, the Hof Criminal Investigation Department and the Public Prosecutor's Office have been working intensively on the case again, according to information received.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Agency, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road near Marxgrün using ground penetrating radar.
With the help of a dog trained to smell human bones, the officers narrowed the area down to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users highlights the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost his license to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also relinquish the position of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He may remain chairman of the board against it.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager for fraud in the US federal court in Manhattan.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than 50 billion dollars on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk let declare that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He had always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, the financing was secured.
This would have valued Tesla at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla stayed on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also establish a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC still managed a 1-1 draw with Chelsea FC.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the attacker, who had just been replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp, scored the 1:1 (0:1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins at the start Liverpool dropped back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, the new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard took the Chelsea lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
Afterwards the Klopp team missed the equalizer several times.
National team player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo by Liverpool goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a swerve into the corner.
Record champion Manchester United slid deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost 3-1 (2-0) to West Ham United, and with ten points after seven days of play remains only in midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion with goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new leader.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports with reference to Llambi's lawyer about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have parted amicably and amicably", the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser announced according to "BamS".
What is most important to them now is the welfare of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple had met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his work as a juror for the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment shows.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel to become chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo is taking several survey hits.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey by the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one point to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU are also losing a count and are now only at 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the federal elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU together would only receive 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently achieve 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal elections they received a total of 53.4 percent.
The range is also wide for the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a share of 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The Left Party averages 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal elections.
Currently only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person for the Chancellor's Office, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of new elections.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed that Merkel's popularity had declined significantly.
The Germans are also divided in their opinion as to whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
According to the survey, 64 percent of CDU/CSU supporters want to run for office, 35 percent do not.
Notice at Aldi: Reduced price for the happiness of love
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the days of Tinder there are no more romantic get-to-know stories - should go to Aldi and talk about turkey.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to get to know the great love almost radiates an anachronistic romanticism.
Yes, that's right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargains at the bargain counter or your favourite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swip to the right.
The App Tinder has a reputation for being less of a contact and more of a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react when you don't beat about the bush in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when the happiness of love is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
When the guy then also contacts his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and their ilk - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is to be wished to the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us that she will find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For believing in the magic of getting to know analogue, she definitely deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has participated in the campaign "Lids against Polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, known in German as polio, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the poliovirus, can so far only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idol
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," Reus, who is a friend of Götze, told TV station Sky after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
This is not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga football club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible extension of his contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract yet.
There's no set date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening on the Sky TV station.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers' appearance VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch was hard on his own.
He was taciturn, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck, withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on his lack of motivation on the green.
All history.
In the meantime things are running smoothly again on Brandhoveweg.
Fresh evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the promotion.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was quite something," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each of them after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had clearly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17.), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26.) and Jan Schroer (38.) missed the lead.
This almost took revenge when the SCA in minute 41, in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, hit the Wolbeck box twice - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes for a Thewes surrender.
With the substitution of Miles Geske Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the home side 18 metres from the visitors' box.
The fouled person competed himself and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flop hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be long as hell.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the ball unluckily into the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) pointed immediately to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske finally scored the winning goal from twelve metres in the 87th minute.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing there was an accident while still at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 14 o'clock on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
During the landing of a helicopter there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill at the side.
The police, ambulance and fire brigade were called immediately.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
As a precaution, the ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called in.
Occupants only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are subject to investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, a small incipient fire occurred, but it was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
This means that only 8 percent of board members were female on the cut-off date of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and which was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to change their position, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by", said foundation managing director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male management teams - with few exceptions - have long since ceased to be conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German listed companies was solely due to positive impulses from the companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure had been 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women were working on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not enter into a voluntary commitment to increase their share from the previous "zero percent".
A different picture emerges with regard to the Supervisory Boards: On September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the boards of directors each year, a share of 40 percent would be reached as early as 2023," the report says.
Some even make a mess of it: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Best earned Ferrari.
The Italians earn 280,000 Euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 Euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Whoever makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This is the question that "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has dealt with.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 Euros with every car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes up to about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money into every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices averaging between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder wine festival
The tourist office in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the big marquee at Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the responsible persons marched through the village to the fairground to the sounds of the marching band from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist office, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already packed marquee. "60 years of doing something like this - that's an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically toasted with the guests from the stage.
"It's good to see so many have found their way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "Die Troglauer" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, on which also the Abtswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5th in the Haus des Gastes, before the second round will take place one day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor's car crashes into taxi
An emergency ambulance is standing next to a road, heavily damaged.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - ideally even save lives.
Such a rescue mission came to a fatal end for a 26-year-old girl in Bonn.
Bonn - In Bonn, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in a collision between an emergency ambulance and a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, according to the police.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor's car had run a red traffic light with flashing lights and sirens on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi that was driving at green.
After the collision, the doctor's car skidded against a traffic light pole and a tree.
In doing so, he captured the passer-by who was still dying at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency ambulance were locked in their vehicles with serious injuries and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she was unable to help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor who was called tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close cooperation with the Bonn public prosecutor's office, are investigating who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, and Mourinho will be uncomfortable
After the disgraceful out in the league cup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU is defeated 1:3 and the manner of the defeat should still be a matter of discussion.
Emblematic was the scene in the 74th minute when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside to Mark Nobel's pass, all the Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a performance that had previously been inadequate for long stretches.
United's city rival Manchester City is currently in a completely different mood.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, achieved an unchallenged 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the home side's defensive barrier for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a one-two with the former goalscorer, ensured a sixth win in the seventh game and a move to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 2-1 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool to a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League.
As at the Cup end, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came onto the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his scoop.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was unbeatable for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, but the draw in the league brought the Blues Liverpool down from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The Gunners' fans, with whom Granite Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute to hear a success story against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxomed Alex Iwobi's cross into his own goal, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season to decide the outcome.
Arsenal passed Watford for the fifth consecutive win and are now fifth, just behind their big rivals Tottenham, while relegated relegated Wolverhampton under Portuguese coach Espirito Santo continues to make a strong impression.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row in the league with a 2-0 win over Southampton, finishing 8th.
VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies, even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be presenting their new products in the French capital from next week onwards, together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel no longer actually plays a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, should still be an important topic, at least behind the gleaming backdrop of the exhibition stands.
One big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz will be there and, among other things, have their first purely electric models with them: the Ingolstadt company's e-tron is scheduled to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart company in 2019.
But both were officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
In the center of attention in Paris is the new 3 Series.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and the following tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was 5.9 on the Richter scale, the second 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged, causing enormous material damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims is still rising significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
But many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
At least the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the powerful two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of every month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
About 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock on the bolides were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first the biker's breakfast pint was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or already with a hearty curry sausage.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic and calm tones", says Pastor Frank Schröder.
Yesterday this was also certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active during the actual action day.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his astonished spectators step by step.
Now and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Probably not many of the children could yet imagine how this would one day become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to watch this important step in the work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a little like shredded material, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step of the work was not that difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer from Füchtorf also had some ready-made specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good wine "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only watch the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been built.
Also active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers got involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also next year the home club will offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the Heimathaus in the heart of the Savings Village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject matter: "After all, the milk will then go round and round.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with a fourth bankruptcy of the season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt/Main After his fourth defeat in the Bundesliga in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the bottom of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-foot professional Pirmin Schwegler and added: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take a lot on yourself.
Lower Saxony, who are still without a win and for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) scored the second goal, are at the bottom of the table with two points and are a candidate for relegation in their current condition.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home victory of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46.300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the European League game against Lazio Rome, the winner advanced to the midfield of the table with seven points.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessians at his debut and could never be controlled by Hannover's defence.
With his speed and assertiveness, the striker, who was long stricken after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
Alongside Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, also made his first appearance in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started off with verve.
A deflected header by Lucas Torró (17) on the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back) who had dropped out at short notice.
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal where Ndicka only had to keep his foot out.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender who came from French second division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt made up ground before the break.
This time, Haller matched his striker partner Rebic, who skilfully refuelled and 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser didn't give him a chance.
In the half time Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little more courageously forward, but there were no brilliant ideas until shortly before the end, when they scored the second goal.
The Hessians were much more efficient there.
Rebic started a solo after just under an hour and then crossed the ball to De Guzmán, who only had to push it into the empty goal.
The rest was just show skating against overstrained guests, even Jovic scored one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who is from the 30-year war and whom, according to legend, a Swedish soldier shot at.
Blood flowed from the bullet wound.
From this, a big pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed that then also led to the building of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not yet been completed, only the chancel is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance for the parish of Geising.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty meals as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction work, which will last until next year.
After the scaffolding had been standing for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become more extensive, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection using scaffolding.
The plinth plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped to be able to complete a good half of this work this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those present at the inauguration ceremony agreed that "a very special house" in Münsterblickstraße would now be dedicated to its purpose.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller residence for some time now are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The initial planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officers' building was put to the test for residents with a handicap: "The building was getting on in years and its furnishings were no longer up to date," explained Bader looking back.
In 2016 the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with many specifications, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move around without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the Swabian district, expressed a similar opinion: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
Kreutmayer said that comfort and functionality had been well combined.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in the current situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to the collective bargaining agreement.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy federal SPD leader, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all compatriots not to put up with the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences", the Minister President of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
He said it was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unification," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two approximately one year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "help the animals get used to the new environment".
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered to be loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the friendship gift at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly bid to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion systems.
Austria's eventful history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question looking back over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, has a completely different approach in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to business as usual - this is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not recently mantra-like conjure up the "return to factual work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and non-work, but so be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - to govern - it should not now be discouraged from doing so by debates on concepts.
Whether the CDU/CSU and the SPD can really achieve anything together after the provocations and embarrassments of the past few weeks will probably be seen as early as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all the controversy.
But first of all, the diesel retrofits and the Immigration of Skilled Workers Act will once again be controversial issues on the agenda.
CSU Transportation Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get off lightly with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as being obliged to technically retrofit older diesel engines.
While a rapprochement has become apparent over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the CDU/CSU and SPD are still far apart on the planned immigration law for skilled workers.
The SPD demands that rejected asylum seekers who work or are in training should have a perspective to stay.
The Union is strictly against the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be quarrels among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social views and priorities.
Quarrel is good.
Without conflict, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests will not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be inflated again for party tactical reasons to the question of being or not being.
This is still politics, not theater.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD should argue - but always keep the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be resolved pragmatically - and confidence can be regained.
That is what the people's parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working times at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Is the Minister of Labour, of all people, in breach of the applicable employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"An exuberant Minister of Social Affairs reported that her lawyers had really been working day and night on the social security reform during their presentation two weeks ago.
Liste-Pilz mandatary Daniela Holzinger is astonished by the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via a question.
She assumes "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of the applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now had questions to "acquit Hartinger of any suspicion".
Police tear up a street in search of a woman's body
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning digging has been going on on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, which was specially trained to smell old human bones, was able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres together with its handler in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the aforementioned road section together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year now, the public prosecutor's office and the Hof criminal investigation department have been working on the missing persons case.
Again and again a cycle path near Marxgrün was blocked off and examined with sonar equipment because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here during the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But even before that, riots break out.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan referendum on independence on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence supporters with paint powder, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and civil guard.
About 3000 officers of the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues who were on duty in the polling stations during last year's illegal referendum.
At that time, violence was also used in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also set themselves off abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was ended.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part ways without scoring
Red-White Ahlen continues to tread water.
FC Gütersloh also only managed a 0-0 draw.
The tail light and the third last one turned out to be a gathered perplexity in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
So if you preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst, you could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - opportunity for the Ahlen-based side was when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parry after 32 minutes with a shot from the edge of the penalty area.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action consisted in an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, with Sinan Aygün replacing him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel scored from 18 metres just over the case and after one hour the Gütersloh team also made their first offensive appearance.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, the game went fast.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the swiftly presented counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also added to their lead with a header from Wieckowicz (66) after a corner from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut reacted, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlen-based company did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that did not bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively "everything splashed a little bit" against a team "that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't have the feeling that we could get a goal against," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the spectators did not have the feeling that his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfeld harvest market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a little empty, but that was to change in the course of the day.
Because: "This is such a nice social place, that's why we are here today", said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good dose of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not miss the opportunity to musically entertain the ever increasing number of visitors in between.
That was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to fit the opening date into his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, most of them clubs.
"Actually, there should not be such a thing as a blackboard at all," he thanked for the action of the male choir nevertheless.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of everyone who worked at the stands and also included the other festivities that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful coat of paint - something is going on here.
Then the May wreath was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
At many stands, work was done for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to savoury was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for one year, got creative with his scroll saw.
Veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfeld Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has one more specialty with him.
Honey cake in a jar, naturally with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to grab it again and again, that's how good the cake tasted.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors stay long into the evening hours, even without the stage programme, which does not exist at the autumn festival.
Schmierereien with local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown persons have advertised the construction of a skate park in a hardly conducive way.
In several places there is corresponding graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" were printed in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among other places.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the career choice fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with a marker at the time, it could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case in particular is given a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of schools, sports and culture has already made commitments, without mentioning any names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with the companies that are on the greasy board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skate parks for years.
After the old one at the LWL Clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the majority of the Council came out in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this location.
This was followed by a turnaround at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says about the current state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council would then have the last word.
He expects a decision to be made this year, so that if the vote is positive, construction could begin in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," the head of the Air Navigation Services Union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the Aviation Summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for next year, but it takes four to five years to train new controllers," the trade unionist said.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
In the Karlsruhe centre for monitoring upper German airspace alone, around a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that several air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work intensification and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned German Air Traffic Control.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission's guidelines for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings for the national air navigation service providers are now having a full impact on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to campaign in Brussels for regulations that "do not further restrict the airspace of air traffic control".
Currently, the EU requirements are coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delays has prompted the airlines to rethink their approach.
The GdF would only help to improve the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offered a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 student pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary increase in personnel is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favor of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden Group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no additional staff reductions beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side has only eight members.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is to be made by an annual general meeting, which is expected to be held in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include among other things the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to combine the elevator and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by police officers and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence supporters have resulted in violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 independence supporters demonstrated.
The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest marches apart.
However, according to information from the emergency services, independence supporters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
According to the information provided, there were also fights between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there have been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the policemen had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who almost exactly one year ago took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil consider it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn considerably more than they do.
The demonstrators considered it a provocation that the Spanish police officers demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez to the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British Ministers
A security hole in a mobile phone app has meant that the personal details of ministers and MPs from the British Conservative Tory Party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the breakdown became known the day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning the Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on the B 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the end of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when their car hit a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played his best game that night, along with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champions' 3-1 (1-1) win over SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game around after the early deficit, scored by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and left the closest challengers behind for the time being.
The Real Madrid goalscorer first laid on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a brace (26th and 49th).
And Ronaldo's header from a corner also helped to prepare for the goal scored by head of defence Leonardo Bonucci (76), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri will also want to see goals from the forward, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to become even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
Best Juve scorer at the moment is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on the line.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The runner-up in the standings, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, did not stand a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the dismissal of Mario Rui (58th), who had already been warned, the leading game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the pitch after a too hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the coach from Turin.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed there.
The German international has won through at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, played in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri meant by the "half hour": Ronaldo was knocked off the pitch in the Turin 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West is changing his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowning and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on he may only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is no news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you"," the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
We did it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak play from us today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we hardly ever gave him any problems". The list of Hoetmarer bullet holes is correspondingly thin.
Just two chances to score in 90 minutes, so it is seldom possible to make games positive.
Football District League A1: SC Hoetmar defeats SG Sendenhorst 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first run, but Maik Krause used the first one from a sharp angle to take an early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preparatory work by Krause he changed his position to free standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed against goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper in the second half.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to take a penalty - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red - for the visitors (75).
Only when Nils Berheide pocketed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, but today it was different than in the last weeks", was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: District league A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh loses to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of that," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." By that he meant presumably the wing tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who stood out with their collective offensive drive.
He was able to laugh anyway: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and then pulling away. His players, on the other hand, were relieved that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting to retain its class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best performance this season," he says.
"How we came back from 2-0, how we held against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal.
All the more bitter, he said, that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goal scorer Lars Zymner put the hosts in the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he put on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.) exemplary.
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"It was madness what he did," Lewandowski enviously acknowledged the quality of his opponent.
Shortly before the changeover, his own team managed to equalise: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed through between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner goal (45th).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59.).
Afterwards it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh were unable to counter the last Concordia goal (80th) again.
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Soccer: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.

Media: entire executive committee of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of second division football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously referred to a joint letter of the Saxony committee.
Initially there was no confirmation from the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few guests of state whose departure in Germany provides such great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, has signalled that he would like to collect the Tolerance Prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn included him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us". The fact that celebrities keep turning up at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective. On September 29, writer Frido Mann will be at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised to come to Tutzing to personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy, which is also awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so conferences up to mid-2019 will be tough.
"Pensions just aren't safe!" is the title of a convention.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - war mocks every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society and the gap between rich and poor to radical changes in work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a conference to mark the 200th anniversary of the founding of the
On the occasion of Karl Marx's 50th birthday, some expect more visitors to come to the exhibition to criticize capitalism, others expect a tendency "from the far left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"After all, we are a 100 percent subsidiary of the Protestant Regional Church", said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner was concerned with the understanding of the sexes, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes gets to speak until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies Teubner so congenially and harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was that too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely in a way that fitted in with the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but she doesn't open the door.
On the other hand, a closed door without a partner is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have been the result of Mozart's composition if "the Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "bravo" from the full hall.
Blumen presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, with the chansonette.
But the chairwoman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not let an additional thank you go.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must relinquish the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also reached an agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC announced.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement in August to take Tesla off the stock market.
In its complaint, the SEC accused Musk of having provided false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the police have slightly reduced the number of victims.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
All of them have been discharged from the hospital in the meantime.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released in the course of the day, a police spokesman said.
The reason for the accident of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on into a crash barrier on Saturday morning without braking.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG just keeps its white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen-based team had particular problems with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"Actually I was quite happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We couldn't get a grip on them," says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final was missing this time his team.
The ASG was therefore trailing almost to the end, was behind at the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (45.).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of the hostesses made itself decisively felt.
In addition, Aydogdu back Merle Klement put Merle Klement on left wing, who then "extremely cleverly scored the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd division women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second league relegation VC Allbau Essen the blue-whites won 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked hard for this," said coach Dominik Münch after his team's almost flawless performance in the overthrown championship leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice champion of the previous year with 25:15.
Food accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We've kept them well occupied.
Our opponent served with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set the BSV was already leading 12:8 "Essen has changed the acceptance to triple bar.
We couldn't hold the impact pressure.
Food was sucked in, and we let ourselves be lulled a little," Münch continues.
At 18:17, the women's volleyball team from the Ruhr area was ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fended off four set points at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now one class better", the trainer said about the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge with their serves contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White brought passage four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shattered mess in German-Turkish relations that can only be swept together with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with top German politicians to underline the Muslims' affiliation with Germany, Erdogan used the date for his own purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Nottuln Homecoming Club: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break it is finally time for Folktreff again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 19.30 o'clock the Heimatverein Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day it is then a year ago that we held a Folktreff for the first time.
Meanwhile this event has become a fixed part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln", says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk club would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
No matter whether storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday", Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The organisers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten delighted the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent it home with a catchy tune.
"We are counting on many cheerful guests to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening", says the invitation of the local history club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and feels like getting actively involved is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 19.30, but admission is already at 19.00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair take another step forward on the way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-euro merger is still pending approval in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
According to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval there had recently improved because Linde had agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and landscape management was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbach clubhouse provided the final impetus for the founding of the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and landscape management, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a major anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach town hall.
Admittedly, at that time it was called something else: in 1893 it was christened "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach City and Country District Fruit Growing Association) by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
Also the purpose of the fruit growing association was different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite of the elites", explained district curator Günter Dippold in his ceremonial lecture.
Fruit trees were to line highways, and so-called industrial gardens were laid out near schools.
Even today, fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which have almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Nature-oriented horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as imparting knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed in an entertaining way on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and Mayor Henry Schramm also emphasized how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a big deal for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to be located is decided by the district association", added District Administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district was also made clear by district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, about the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came from the garden, for the winter it was tinned.
At the end of the 50s, however, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was there before us and we have to take our cue from it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian regional association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren", Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower brass band of the Thurnau Music Society.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada's Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on the NAFTA issue: it is giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister will address the United Nations General Assembly only on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she is concentrating on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada is to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
In August, the USA and Mexico agreed on a new version of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are now to be finalized by Sunday evening (local time), Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event that the negotiations fail, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in the open street during an election campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements in social networks.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former mayor of the megacity São Paulo, Haddad has so far lagged far behind the extreme right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Brazil's "trump card" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labour Party should be shot.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale on the outskirts of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's underdog team dethroned the favoured defending champion USA in front of more than 150,000 spectators during the three days at Le Golf National with great shots and outstanding team spirit around a toothless Tiger Woods.
After long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been under treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band split up in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark today.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who "was against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that in 2010 the monarchy's opponent Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger". The band names alone of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends of each other.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the "Mosquito" booking agency from Oelde - and their bands will visibly delight the 120 or so visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the newest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" shouts cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not always hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, however, has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, together with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo, while walking through the audience.
A certain volume is a matter of course at such a hard rock concert, depending on the genre: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixer team, the triple concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is about on the level of a jackhammer, but is still well below the output of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" points out on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience doesn't need the deafening 120 decibels at jet propulsion volume that is usual at the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking style have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger", all three groups can say at the end, admittedly in a figurative sense.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One man killed in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
On Sunday a glider crashed on a parking lot at the airport Mülheim/Essen.
The pilot died in the crash.
A fatal accident occurred near the airport Mülheim/Essen on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a glider had crashed in the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot had been killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the student pilot was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the aircraft was already on approach.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend there is an Oktoberfest.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city limits of the two cities in the Ruhr area and directly at the access road to the Autobahn 52.
There is a Park&Ride offer from the car park for large events at Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump worships Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President of North Korea's ruler Kim is quite well-disposed towards the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has declared his support for a new flame.
The tragedy is that it's a long-distance relationship.
In public Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half as old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although he is proving to be a rather tough nut to crack in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and we went back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection had also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to Kim's announcement that all nuclear and missile tests would be stopped, even if critics have so far paid little more than lip service to it.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - notorious for his threatening martial gestures, might not be right for everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it during his performance in a large sports hall in Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How awful, how awful is that?
That is so unpresidential.
But he cared very little about it, Trump explained, then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential.
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there crowding into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, full of atmosphere and on top of that spoiled by sunshine: Very diversified and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's city centre was dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to draw attention to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at the risk of their lives and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
According to his own statement, he put himself in mortal danger with the video.
One of his comrades-in-arms was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't feed us, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
He has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the Ort elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the vestibule of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then across the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Description of the offender: Approx. 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please send any information to the police station Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to wait in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Middle Franconia after he got stuck in his car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by chance not far from a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was said to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He stated that he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he did not return from a trip in his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet warns of the rule of law in Turkey
In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has, according to his own statements, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns above all waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to deepen, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to his own statements, Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Erdogan had thereupon again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense's Air Readiness Department at Cologne airport.
Originally it had been planned to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the situation more soberly.
Foreign Minister Ri demands a concession from Washington.
During the UN general debate, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear weapons-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The recent deadlock is due to the fact that the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat explained.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who do not know us".
To build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, the minister criticized that there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly adhere to the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump had first met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT is serving: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth club, the many visitors of the open house HoT didn't realize: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to express their gratitude by eating.
But the start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, there was a nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of order, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it on their own," said Westbuer.
And so everyone pitched in.
The result was impressive and the guests were enthusiastic.
"Chefs can't do better than that either," praised one visitor, impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, meat loaf or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put together," emphasised Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the audience with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board of the Tafel
Frustrated by criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essener Tafel had introduced a ban on admission of foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice chairman of the NRW-Tafeln, Sartor told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
I've had too many stabbed in the back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed his understanding to dpa for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor had taken the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people have expressed themselves who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel is doing this".
However, Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag", Sartor in turn criticized colleagues from other boards.
One should not take the approach that "without us the people in the city will starve to death".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve to death.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the Tafel on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet talk," he said.
There are all these social cunts who criticized me like that back then.
SF Lorch lose 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Soccer, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2-0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2-3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
Quite different from the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won 2:1 after 90 minutes, while at the top of the table, SGB was able to win 3:0
Gladbach gambled away two leads - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals missed the lead twice.
Schalke achieves their first victory of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke manoeuvred himself into the offside with early goals in the first five league games.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team has returned to the strength with which they finished first behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf put the home side in the lead in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts then preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is now greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had been trailing 0-2 against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still managed to achieve a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning conclusion of the performance improvement after the break with another double in the final phase (86th/94th).
VfB Stuttgart also achieved their first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, which had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart team had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in goal that helped the guests to equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro finally led VfB to their first win.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave up the lead twice, ultimately playing 2-2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 equaliser with his second Bundesliga team.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the Aargau player's low shot from 20 metres, as he was when he scored his second goal on the hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is proving to be a goal getter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record-breaking score from the OGC Nice scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counterattack, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to push his team: The 23-year-old Serb scored after a jersey pick against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen team back into the game with a curious throw-in (68th), but a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart team back onto the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 in a sovereign manner.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with a foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether the name of their country should be changed to Northern Macedonia.
A yes vote could resolve the conflict with its neighbour Greece, which has been smouldering for almost three decades.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future integration into the West.
The USA had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum had a positive outcome.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and injured them, some of them seriously.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the escape alley in Alsergrund on Friday around 10 pm.
When the policemen arrived, they addressed the accused, who was clenching his fists when he attacked passers-by and tried to attack them.
Thereupon the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had shortly before beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also trampled the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for reasons as yet unknown", as the police stated.
He was taken to hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into effect for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"When we get married, we're gonna do it right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for budgetary policy of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on opening up marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with an angry speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
A great deal of work lay ahead of the members of the citizen association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy Research.
Because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," explained the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And there's a lot of stuff piled up, too.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a topiary.
Because the hedge has already been clipped once in spring.
Breakfast, which always follows work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should keep up their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championship
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old did a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the course and everything was perfect today," said the London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist.
At the finish he threw away his paddle for joy and raised both arms confident of victory - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second place went to the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted break-in to a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this fall.
The fact that the test on the detached house on Königswieser Straße was successful is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators lent a hand on Friday shortly before 8 pm.
The burglars did suspect that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they took flight without any prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Broke Hertha: Caught up in reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The unbeatable predicate is gone: FC Bayern will not "put up with" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion of Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small dent in performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not turn into a major autumnal low for the Munich team.
"A week ago, we were under the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit," said Thomas Müller after the well-deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC, demanding a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that this really annoys us and that's why we're speeding towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, the team did not score a goal away from home, just as it had failed to win two matches in a row at the same time in the previous season, losing the lead in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is far from being as dramatic as it was during the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with their running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful pinpricks on the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days on how to crack the seemingly overpowering Bavarians.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac emphasized.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and blamed his first defeat as a Munich coach solely on a renewed lack of opportunity.
A win against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2-0 win at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 in the opening match, begins as planned.
"We've had two games now, but we'll be scoring again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plain language.
The legal defense attorney acted in the role of an admonisher.
"I don't think that this is all bad luck, we have to work for it again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," emphasised the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, the Bavarians were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a one-point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a wink of the eye, at least evaluated positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association's line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent controversial topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the way the former world champion was treated in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association's line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was sharply attacked by Özil himself, announced the consequences of the case in the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The latter had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay were born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they had themselves photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he had felt "treated reasonably by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time he announced that he would like to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said so.
However, he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is to be appointed in addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says: 'This is an important issue, we have to deal with it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work", said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the office of DFB President again next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
But there was no exchange of personal data, because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had gone off the road and hit a delineator.
Asked about this, the man did not want any police on the spot and then drove away.
Afterwards the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his home town, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much of what happened.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 Euro.
Moor fire in Meppen: Still almost 1000 troops in action.
Some four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland region, 980 firefighters are still busy with the fire-fighting operations.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, according to a spokesperson, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency forces is planned, it is said.
In the night to Sunday an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which had been declared on 21 September a good week earlier, was lifted because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighbouring forests and settlements through wind and flying sparks.
On Thursday it was said that there was no longer a threat of the fire spreading to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 rescue workers tried to get the fire under control.
The air force continues to support the work at the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the German Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire had been started by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke plume of the bog fire had at times travelled up to a hundred kilometres across north-west Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into effect for everyone, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into effect, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we're gonna get married, we're gonna get married for real.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for budgetary policy of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on opening up marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with an angry speech.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state name begins
In Macedonia the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in future.
This is insisted upon by our neighbour Greece because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement of Skopje with the EU and Nato for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for the integration of their country into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on 30 September.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in 2016 in the USA, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with express consent, emphasises Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still - as in Germany - only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment among potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the interviews, the relatives do not know the deceased's wishes.
"They must then make decisions on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered as an organ donor, unless he or a relative objects.
Among other things the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He prevailed against 39 competitors in Wolfsburg this weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball in the air with his head while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already present in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
Organiser Laue can't do much with terms like super brain, genius or child prodigy.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even arithmetic competitions held in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, square-root extraction from six-digit numbers.
In versatility calculation, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because they learn mental arithmetic more intensively and with different, effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her sensitive and emotional side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and advocate early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams almost died a year ago herself.
There were complications in the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery was performed to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbols Law" for review.
This is intended to significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time next week in the West: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall line drops to between 1,500 and 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to around 1,000 metres with a high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start with the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual bend maintenance on Monday.
The "green ramparts", unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of this sparsely forested federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "substitute for woodland" and the last refuge for many animals and plants.
Curtsies connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, interwoven demarcations could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed in one kilometre of bend.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it will wither to a light row of trees, which will not only lose biodiversity but also wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling maintenance may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about SItuation on site
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local journalist Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you yourself on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately set off back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours by car after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and petrol.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and it is difficult to find them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but it didn't work before and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people of whom they do not know whether they are alive or where they are, because during the earthquakes people were not at home but, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many people thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it did come.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami would hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific ring of fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the whole infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be absent from VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a torn muscle fibre in his rear left thigh in the 2:1 match against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga team announced on Sunday.
The doctors diagnosed Donis with a torn muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime.
A torn muscle bundle usually heals within six to eight weeks, a torn muscle fibre usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the annual cycle of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the farewells to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at the Olching Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water rescue station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services again and again.
In the end she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and force it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box by a fireman with a bold grip after almost an hour.
The duck, injured on the chest, was then brought to the animal hospital of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for World Championship medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard for a long time.
Next winter the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint in Pyeongchang the medal which was within reach.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze at the end.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," said Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championships track in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard's heart: "I have already taken the track to my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth world cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympic Games he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the past World Cup winter.
With the relay he ran in Oslo (NOR) on rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations very limited.
With a turbocharged FBI investigation, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial because of allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to clear up suspected incidents that occurred more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama of Kavanaugh's appeal, which was accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared that he would agree but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's heavy reproaches "cheating", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One government representative told the "Wall Street Journal" that they would specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, nothing more, "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality of Ried, the mobile radar unit installed in a "civilian vehicle" to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first victory of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to make the narrow 1-0 win against Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
But it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "All in all, the first half was good, both in terms of play and pressing," Tedesco said.
Don't actually create a headshot monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.
The boys were afraid to let it out of their hands and therefore they withdrew more and more.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all have a huge load off our mind," said Schöpf, who played no small part in this with his header: "But I am actually the worst header in the team.
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, including Tedesco of course.
"We wanted to start with a powerful start in the initial phase and make a firework display of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours of happiness.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59th/72nd or Amine Harit 62nd.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shaking victory," Tedesco said: "You could feel the fear a little bit.
So I'm glad we won.
That didn't make him the only one a teaser.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was hard to miss.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal valley on Sunday around 13.30 hrs.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to rubbish on a two square metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appeared that he had supervised the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And it's near the forest.
30 Fischbachau fire fighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing the fire.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Before them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years now, I have made it my business to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very casually, describes the process of writing the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and the odd joke or two, he brings one of the most conflict-ridden topics closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, the first generation of immigrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This would lead to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?
At the beginning rather restrained, then more and more lively the discussion starts.
And there's a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the signing session that followed, he listened attentively to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer there was intensive discussion over prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen won a hard-fought match in their own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious team from Bonn won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied to purchase one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the Landsham South development area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick announces this.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots of land that the municipality is offering at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model - has been completed.
According to Frick, a good 100 applications have been received.
"Currently the documents are being checked", regarding the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present it to the municipal council.
The award could then take place.
A total of 50 plots for detached and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with an anticipated eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
A single plot of land as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the community are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments subsidised by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, the area of the Landsham-South development area will provide living space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, Frick says, the start of the construction of a new day care centre is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting eleven for the third time in a row: Nevertheless Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been in the Schalker starting eleven for the third time in a row but on the substitutes' bench, many people would have been very sympathetic if the almost two-metre tall Brazilian had really got rid of his frustration.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity's sake, stepped in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, did not hold any grudges.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best rogue last season, knows that he has not been sidelined by his coach - but is being given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you that honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo he was not in the starting eleven.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the cause, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the move.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breather these days.
And that we keep everyone in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench as well.
In August, the mood in Austrian industry accelerated its decline in comparison to the euro zone.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50 mark, which indicates growth, for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland's industrial sector broke through this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks came in last (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, the highest level since March.
"The slightly weaker decline could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains the number one brake on growth - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro zone fell at the highest rate since November 2011.
Companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production in August fell more sharply than initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially anticipated 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehousing and prices are surveyed.
Tuchel's PSG team achieves eighth victory in eighth league match
29 September 2018 at 7:45 pm
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champions won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and were thus also successful in their eighth league match.
The last time Olympique Lyon in France had made such a good start to the season was 82 years ago.
